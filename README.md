# Credit Card Fraud Prediction

## Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both credit card companies and customers, as fraudulent transactions can result in financial losses. This project aims to develop a predictive model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It includes a highly unbalanced distribution of transactions, with only 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions, accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.
